# Summary

Fuck You Telecom's GUI for configuring phones.

# More Details

Fuck You Telecom is an art installation that occasionally appears at regional burns, most notably Burning Flipside. We set up a phone system that camps can use to wreak havoc on each other. We pride ourselves on our quality disservice.

Configuring those phones is really fucking hard. Normally, you'd need to do it from the command line. But thanks to this GUI, we can configure them much more easily.
